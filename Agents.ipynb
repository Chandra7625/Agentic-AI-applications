It should be noted that if a flight operated by one of the carrier\\'s codeshare partners is selected, then such operating carrier\\'s contractual conditions may differ to these Conditions of Carriage, particularly with regard to the provisions set out in paragraph below (Terms and Conditions) of these Conditions of Carriage.\\\\nCodeshare flights will be affixed with a  during flight selection. Currently, IndiGo (subject to change at short notice) has a codeshare agreement with Turkish Airlines.\\\\nTerms and Conditions\\\\nIf the flight that is chosen is being operated by the carrier\\'s codeshare partner, the flight will be operated by a carrier that is not the carrier which issued the ticket, i.e. the marketing carrier.\\\\nIf the flight is operated by a carrier other than the marketing carrier, the conditions of carriage applicable to the operation of such flight, will be the conditions of carriage of the operating carrier, and if any differences arise between operating carrier\\'s conditions of carriage and these Conditions of Carriage, the operating carrier\\'s conditions of carriage will take precedence. All operating carrier\\'s conditions of carriage can be found on the operating carrier\\'s own website.\\\\nIn particular, aspects of service provision such as minimum check-in period, unaccompanied minors, Customers requiring medical assistance, infants, pregnant Customers, boarding the flight, carriage of animals, refusal of admission onboard, provision of oxygen tanks onboard, irregular operations, denied boarding, Baggage collection, free Baggage allowance, wheelchair assistance, lounge access, frequent flyer program accrual and limits of liability in relation to lost Baggage, amongst other conditions, should be carefully examined and must be adhered to. In cases where a Booking includes flights that are operated by one or more carriers, the operating carrier will be indicated at the time of Booking. If the operating carrier is unknown at the time the Booking is made, or if a change occurs after the Booking is made, the operating carrier will be indicated to the Customer once the operating carrier is confirmed.\\\\nBookings made through channels which are not under direct control of IndiGo (e.g. travel agencies and websites other than the Website), the travel agents and website operators that executed the agreement with the Customer are liable to inform the Customers of the identity of the operating carrier, and of any change in operating carrier. The Customer shall provide the correct contact details at the time of Booking to make such notifications possible.To view, the conditions of carriage of Turkish Airlines,click here.\\\\n\\\\nShare Feedback\\\\n Please enter valid email address. \\\\nCOMPANY\\\\n\\\\nAbout us\\\\nIndiGo Green – ESG report\\\\n6E Embrace - Diversity Equity & Inclusion\\\\nIndiGoReach - Our CSR initiatives\\\\nBoard of Directors\\\\nLeadership Team\\\\nInvestor Relations\\\\nInterGlobe Enterprises\\\\nRPWD - Equal Opportunity Policy\\\\nTransgender Persons Policy\\\\nHIV/AIDS workplace policy\\\\nSeat/Aircraft information\\\\n\\\\nSUPPORT\\\\n\\\\nPlan B\\\\nSpecial/Disability Assistance\\\\nMedical Assistance\\\\nSeat Select\\\\n6E Eats\\\\nAdd-ons & Services\\\\nBaggage\\\\nRefund Claim\\\\nCharter Services\\\\nHotels\\\\n6Eskai\\\\nContact Us\\\\nIndiGo CarGo\\\\nFAQ\\'s\\\\n\\\\nQUICK LINKS\\\\n\\\\nTariff Sheet\\\\nOffers\\\\nCareers\\\\nAdvertise with us\\\\nSitemap\\\\nDestinations\\\\nBlogs\\\\nTerms and Conditions\\\\nConditions of carriage\\\\nPrivacy Policy\\\\nDisclaimer\\\\nInternational Travel Tips\\\\nWeb check-in advisory\\\\nPurchase requirement\\\\nDownload app\\\\nFlight status\\\\nDomestic Flights\\\\nInternational Flights\\\\nPassenger Charter\\\\n\\\\nMEDIA\\\\n\\\\nPress releases\\\\nOur awards\\\\nTestimonials\\\\nHello 6E Magazine\\\\n\\\\nAwards\\\\n Best Low Cost Airline-Asia Passenger Choice Awards Best Low Cost Airline-Central Asia\\\\nSOCIAL MEDIA\\\\nfacebookTwitterInstagramLinkedIn\\\\nDOWNLOAD APP\\\\n\\\\niOS / Android\\\\n\\\\n+917065145858\\\\nConnect with us on WhatsApp\\\\n\\\\nSite map\\\\nPrivacy Policy\\\\nTerms & condition\\\\nCookie Policy\\\\nCyber security\\\\nDisclaimer\\\\n\\\\n@Copyright 2025 IndiGo All rights reserved.\"}], \"response_time\": 5.2}', name='indigo', id='365d0680-e95a-4304-b028-5d2774c02135', tool_call_id='call_pPQ1lXTbfDYHhuEcP2BZKt9o')]}}\n"
